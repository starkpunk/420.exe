<h1>Three AM, Let Down playing</h1>
<p>I'm listening to Let Down at 3am, I forgot to pull out my flashdrive full of stuff and suddenly it started smoking,</p>
<p>I inhale it slowly, curious if it's just short-circuit smoke or the smoke of all those stories,</p>
<p>I realize it's not electronics burning, my head spins and there are strange sounds in my ears,</p>
<p>everything feels real, my eyes red, and that's where it all begins,</p>
<p>the smoke wraps around me like night, making every memory feel alive again</p>
<div>everything sharp but unreal
<p>and thatâ€™s where it starts
