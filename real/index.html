  <h1>three am, let down playing</h1>
  <p>i'm listening to let down at 3am, i forgot to pull out my flashdrive full of stuff and suddenly it started smoking,</p>
  <p>i inhale it slowly, curious if it's just short-circuit smoke or the smoke of all those stories,</p>
  <p>i realize it's not electronics burning, my head spins and there are strange sounds in my ears,</p>
  <p>everything feels real, my eyes red, and that's where it all begins,</p>
  <p>the smoke wraps around me like night, making every memory feel alive again</p>
  
  <div>everything sharp but unreal</div>
  <p>and thatâ€™s where it starts</p>
